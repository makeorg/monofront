Feature: Intro card on sequence
  I want to disable intro card on sequence
  
  Scenario: display intro card
    Given I am on the sequence page of the question "question-0-slug"
    Then I see "Des milliers de citoyens proposent des solutions." in "intro-card-title" container
    And I see "Prenez position sur ces solutions & proposez les vôtres." in "intro-card-text-0" container
    And I see "Les meilleures détermineront nos actions." in "intro-card-text-1" container

  Scenario: Track start sequence after click on intro card button
    Given I monitor API "postTracking" requests
    And I am on the sequence page of the question "question-0-slug"
    When I click on "intro card start" button
    Then event "click-start-sequence" should be tracked by Make with parameters values:
      | name                | value                                                               |
      | eventType           | trackCustom                                                         |

      | url                 | http://localhost:9009/FR/consultation/question-0-slug/selection     |
    And card "2" is visible
    And card "2" is a proposal card
    And progress bar is "2" on "16"

  Scenario: Disable intro card from query
    Given I am on the sequence page of the question "question-0-slug" with intro card disabled
    Then card "1" is visible
    And card "1" is a proposal card

  Scenario: Track vote with intro card disabled
    Given I monitor API "postTracking" requests
    And I am on the sequence page of the question "question-0-slug" with intro card disabled
    When I vote "agree" on the first proposal of sequence
    And event "click-sequence-first-vote" should be tracked by Make with parameters values:
    | name                | value                                                                               |
