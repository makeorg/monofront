Feature: Sequence controversial
  I want to display a controversial sequence
  
  Scenario: Track display on sequence
    Given I monitor API "postTracking" requests
    When I go to the sequence controversial page of the question "question-0-slug"
    Then I see "Propositions controvers√©es" in "main" container
    And event "display-sequence" should be tracked by Make with parameters values:
