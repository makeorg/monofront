Feature: Demographic sequence card
  I want to see the demographic sequence card 
  
  Scenario: Display demographic card and skip
    Given I monitor API "postTracking" requests
    And I am on the sequence page of the question "question-0-slug"
    When I go to card "4"
    Then current card is a demographic card
    And I see "skip demographics" button on card "4"
    And event "display-demographics" should be tracked by Make with parameters values:
