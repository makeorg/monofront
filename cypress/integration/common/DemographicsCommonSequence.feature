Feature: Demographic sequence card

  Scenario: Display demographic card and skip
  Given I am on the common sequence page of the question "question-0-slug"
  When I go to card "3" from card "1"
  Then current card is a demographic card
  And I see "skip demographics" button on card "3"
  When I click on "skip demographics" button
  Then current card is a proposal card
  When I click on "previous card" of the current card
  Then progress bar is "3" on "15"
  And current card is a demographic card
  And I see "Merci pour votre r√©ponse" in the current card
  When I click on "demographic-continue-vote" button
  Then progress bar is "4" on "15"

  Scenario: Display demographic card and skip tracking
  Given I monitor API "postTracking" requests
  And I am on the common sequence page of the question "question-0-slug"
  When I go to card "3" from card "1"
  Then current card is a demographic card
  And I see "skip demographics" button on card "3"
  And common event "display-demographics" on question "question-0-slug" should be tracked by Make with parameters values:
