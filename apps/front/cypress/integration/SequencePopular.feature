Feature: Sequence popular
  I want to display a popular sequence
  
  Scenario: Track display on sequence
    Given I monitor API "postTracking" requests
    When I go to the sequence popular page of the question "question-0-slug"
    Then I see "Les propositions les plus populaires" in "main" container
    And event "display-sequence" should be tracked by Make with parameters values:
      | name                | value                                                                   |
      | eventType           | trackCustom                                                             |

    And event "display-intro-card" should be tracked by Make with parameters values:
      | name                | value                                                               |

    And event "click-start-sequence" should not be tracked by Make
